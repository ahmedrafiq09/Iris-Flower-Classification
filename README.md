# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower Classification Project is an endeavor aimed at harnessing the power of machine learning to accurately identify and classify different species of iris flowers based on their unique characteristics. This project focuses on leveraging advanced algorithms to analyze the morphological features of iris flowers and develop a robust classification model.

Iris flowers are renowned for their distinct characteristics, and this project specifically targets three main species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset used for training and testing the model includes a comprehensive collection of iris samples, each meticulously measured for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
